This folder contains the following file:
1. Playbook.yml
2. Dockerfile
3. Vuln.php
4. Apache2.conf.    
5. Security.conf
6. mysite.conf

Note: Apache2 and security files are created with the security setting modified (disable directory listing, ServerTockens/ServerSignature and load ssl module for https ) to replaced the original files. 

Steps to execute the playbook properly: 
1- On the node machine, install openssh, python and pip 
2- Save the remining files (Dockerfile, vuln.php, apache2.conf and security.conf) in the admin machine to transfer it to the node machine 
3- Make sure to change the path of Dockerfile and vuln.php in the playbook based on where you saved them in your machine
4- you should also have hosts file that contain the IP to the node machine
